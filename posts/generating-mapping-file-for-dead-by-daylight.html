         <h5>Introduction</h5>
         <p>A mapping (.usmap) file is required to read data from the game files of any video game running on Unreal Engine 5. Dead by Daylight runs on Unreal Engine 5.2.1. You can use <a href="https://fmodel.app/">FModel</a> to explore game files created by Unreal Engine, provided that you have both a mapping file (if relevant) and the <a href="extracting-aes-key-for-dead-by-daylight">AES key</a> (if relevant) associated with the particular video game that you are trying to explore.</p>
         <h5>Instructions</h5>
         <p>The following is a list of instructions required to generate a mapping file for Dead by Daylight:</p>
         <p>1. Visit <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/</a> and left-click on the appropriate download link.</p>
         <p>2. Head to the location of the completed download and run Visual Studio Installer. In the Visual Studio Community 2022 section, left-click on "Modify". Ensure that, in the "Workloads" section and in the "Desktop & Mobile" category, you have "Desktop development with C++" checked. Left-click on "Install".</p>
         <p>3. Visit <a href="https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7">https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7</a>, left-click on "Code", and then left-click on "Download ZIP". Save the compressed (zipped) folder of "Dumper-7-main" into the directory of your choice.</p>
         <p>4. Extract the contents of the compressed (zipped) folder "Dumper-7-main" into the directory of your choice.</p>
         <p>5. Open the "Dumper-7-main" directory and open the Dumper-7 Visual Studio Solution file in Visual Studio 2022. A "Review Solution Actions" prompt will appear, and you should left-click on "OK". The project will then be loaded.</p>
         <p>6. Once the project has loaded, head to the drop-down that reads "Debug" and change it to "Release". Head to the menu bar and left-click on "Build". Left-click on "Build Solution". Wait for your output to indicate that the build has completed. After the build has completed, close Visual Studio 2022.</p>
         <p>7. Return to the "Dumper-7-main" directory, left-click on its "x64" subdirectory, and then left-click on its "Release" subdirectory. You should now see that you have a Dumper-7 dynamic-link library (DLL). To inject it, you will need <a href="https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/">Process Hacker</a>.</p>
         <p>8. Visit <a href="https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php">this</a> URL and, under both "Windows 7 and Windows 8" and "Setup", left-click on "processhacker-2.39-setup.exe".</p>
         <p>9. Head to the location of the completed download and run Process Hacker Setup. Install Process Hacker.</p>
         <p>10. Head to where Dead by Daylight is installed. Left-click on its "DeadByDaylight" subdirectory, then left-click on its "Binaries" subdirectory, and then left-click on its "Win64" subdirectory.</p>
         <p>11. Right-click on the "DeadByDaylight-Win64-Shipping" application and create a shortcut for it within that directory. Right-click on the shortcut and left-click on "Properties". At the end of the "Target" text field, press the space bar key and write "-eac-nop-loaded" such that your "Target" text field includes both the file path for the "DeadByDaylight-Win64-Shipping" application and the launch option that you just wrote. Left-click on "Apply", and then left-click on "OK".</p>
         <p>12. Open Process Hacker and search "Dead" in the "Search Processes (Ctrl+K)" text field to filter your list of processes to only include Dead by Daylight. Initially, nothing should appear as you have not yet launched Dead by Daylight.</p>
         <p>13. Double-click on the shortcut that you created to launch Dead by Daylight without Easy Anti-Cheat. Ensure that Steam is running before double-clicking on the shortcut.</p>
         <p>14. Load to the title screen (where Dead by Daylight prompts you to "PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE") but do not click anything.</p>
         <p>15. Return to Process Hacker and you should now see Dead by Daylight listed as a running process. Right-click on it, then hover over "Miscellaneous", and then left-click on "Inject DLL". Your file explorer will open so that you can select a DLL to inject. Return to the directory that contains your Dumper-7 DLL and double-click it.</p>
         <p>16. The Dumper-7 DLL will now run. After the output reads "Generating SDK took (<i>x</i>ms)", head to your C drive (C:), then left-click on its "Dumper-7" directory, then left-click on its subdirectory that is named after the particular game version of Dead by Daylight that you dumped the mapping file for, and then left-click on its "Mappings" subdirectory. The file in that subdirectory is your mapping file. You can now close Dead by Daylight.</p>
