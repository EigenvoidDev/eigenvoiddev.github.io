Responding to the abduction of five brothers-in-arms, the Hellshire Gang stormed in with six-shooters and dynamite. What began as a standoff with the Mason Kelly Gang quickly broke down into a chaotic war zone. Guns fired indiscriminately in a desperate bid for self-preservation, cutting through gang members and civilians alike.<br><br>When the dust settled, the dead outnumbered the living. The hostages were discovered to have been long killed, their bodies disemboweled, guts strewn across town. In a silent rage, the few surviving Hellshire members rounded up their injured enemies and finished them in the same gruesome manner. By nightfall, only the crows remained, feasting gluttonously upon their victory.</p>

                           <p>To students who were bullied by their teachers and classmates, attending Midwich Elementary School was comparable to torture. As the Order's grip on the town's supernatural energies tightened, a transformation occurred. The childhood trauma that took place in the building manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design.<br><br>Though desks and textbooks remain, they're eerily contrasted with stained walls, rusted chains, and hanging cadavers. Any notion that this could have been a place of innocence and learning has long since faded.</p>

It has long traveled through The Fog, moving from realm to realm, and now temporarily camps here.<br><br>Beware: only a fool would let the bright colors seduce them into visiting.</p>

The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed.</p>

More than a century old, the dwelling is in surprisingly good condition, though it shows signs of often being patched and mended. The forest holds the house tightly in its grasp, growing over and around it like a second skin. Only once inside is it clear that someone still lives there. It is warm and welcoming and lovingly decorated, with a large living space, a bedroom and a corner dedicated for little ones. Here they are protected from the harsh winter of the northern forest.</p>

                           <p>Tucked among the majestic slopes near Ormond there lies a deep scar running through the rock and roots. The promise of its vast natural resources drew unscrupulous surveyors to its ice-capped peaks. Upon discovering rich coal deposits, they set up shop, but a series of unexplainable mishaps forced them to close the mine before it was exhausted. <br>They abandoned the complex and left the nearby town to pick up the pieces. After laying silent for decades, rumors swirl that someone else has taken residence among the rusting machines... a group whose motivations are far darker, and far more mysterious.<br>At night, an uneasy silence falls over the complex, punctuated only by the groaning of decaying machines.</p>

There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.</p>

Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.</p>

Paths that welcomed weary travelers, were now thick with vegetation growing damp and unrestrained. The sculptures were a haven for moss and lichen, concealing a scratched and brittle stone.<br><br>Kazan shuddered with rage as he stepped into the area. Unable to restrain himself, he unleashed his might on a statue atop the shrine, clubbing its arms and head to pieces. Even after he left, a rot seemed to pervade the air. The chimes of bells played softly on the wind, as everything around them crumbled. Torn from Kazan's memories, the shrine now stood on the estate of his childhood home—a trick by The Entity that infuriated him even more.</p>

                           <p>Once opulent and well-tended by priests, the shrine was abandoned for reasons unknown. Season after season, the harsh and unforgiving weather corroded its grandeur. Paths that welcomed weary travelers, were now thick with vegetation growing damp and unrestrained. The sculptures were a haven for moss and lichen, concealing a scratched and brittle stone.<br><br>Kazan shuddered with rage as he stepped into the area. Unable to restrain himself, he unleashed his might on a statue atop the shrine, clubbing its arms and head to pieces. Even after he left, a rot seemed to pervade the air. The chimes of bells played softly on the wind, as everything around them crumbled. Torn from Kazan's memories, the shrine now stood on the estate of his childhood home—a trick by The Entity that infuriated him even more.</p>
